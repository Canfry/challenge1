# MARIO CHALLENGE

The goal is to reproduce in the terminal the pyramids of bricks that we see on the Mario game (see assets folder).

You have to prompt the user to decide the height of the pyramid (for exemple between 1 and 8), in order to display the pyramid as shown on the assets folder. Let's use hashtags to represent the bricks.
